# Telegram Coding Bot

This is a Telegram bot built using Node.js and Telegraf library to provide coding solutions, specifically focusing on various sorting algorithms and search algorithms. The bot responds to different commands by sending the code of algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Binary Search, and Linear Search.

## Features
- Provides code for popular sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort).
